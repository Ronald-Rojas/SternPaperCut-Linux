# SternPaperCut-Linu`x
This applicatoion is for the Stern papercut application. Stern did not have a papercut applicationand this appliation was made to fill that void. 
The application currently works through the terminal. By running the exacutable "pc-client-linux.sh" as a root user the application will run normally. 
On the initial start the printer needs to be configured before it Papercut@Stern can be used the Print@Stern uri destination needs to be changed to "lpd://papercut.stern.nyu.edu/print@stern". Afterwards the user can sign in and use his Stern credentials similarly to the Windows or Mac application. 
A shell script using bash is currently being created to make the application easier to install.
